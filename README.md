## About
Differently is a press kit creation tool which uses the structure of [dopresskit](http://dopresskit.com/) by Rami Ismail, but is different in process and execution. Differently uses plain HTML for editing, and allows you to choose the order of your images, delete sections, and overall is very maleable.

The aim is for developers to be able to create and customize presskits for their games quickly and easily, within the structure of a familiar format. It's free to use and modify, and suggestions are totally welcome.
